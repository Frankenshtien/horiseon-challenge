# Code Refactor Challenge

In this challene I was tasked with refactoring existing HTML and CSS code to make it cleaner, and give it better accessability. <br> 
**I did this with the HTML by:** <br>
- Adding a proper title
- Adding semantic elements to the HTML such as 
    - header
    - nav
    - section
    - footer
- Adding alt tags to important images
- Adding comments where useful
- Fixing links that didn't work

### Example of semantic elements.

**And with the CSS by:** <br>
- Rearranging selectors to make if follow semantic structure
- Consolidating multiple selectors to a single one to do the same job
- Adding comments that follow semantic structure to divide sections
